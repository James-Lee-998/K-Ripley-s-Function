# K-Ripley-s-Function
Modified version of K-Ripley's function, specific for clustering analysis of fluorescent images

Hi David, Most of the explanations are given as hashes on the side (#). FUN refers to the function files and python defines functions as def. So lines starting with def just refer to a function
Most of the images are made using this code but this code only works with the directory listing that I have set up in the safesend file I sent you
Each of the files should contain a 'SQSTM1/TAX/OPTN.txt & CYT.txt' file and these are read by the code. 

To run code specifically you will have to run it in powershell or you can also run it on linux.
Lyceum refers to iridis4 the supercomputer at NOCs so you can also run it through any other linux command line give that the packages are there. 

This is only a short description and I'd be more than happy to provide more indepth explanations and if you would like to have a meeting afterwards about applications of this code I'd be more than happy to oblige.
